# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

At ProxyScraper, we take security seriously. If you discover any security-related issues or vulnerabilities within the project, please report them to us immediately by following these steps:

1. **Ensure the Vulnerability is not Publicly Disclosed**: Before reporting the vulnerability, ensure that it has not been publicly disclosed yet. If the vulnerability is already public, please provide details about where it has been disclosed.

2. **Privately Disclose the Vulnerability**: Send an email to [Mmdrza@USA.COM](mailto:mmdrza@usa.com) with a detailed description of the vulnerability. Please provide as much information as possible, including steps to reproduce the vulnerability and any potential impact it may have.

3. **Encryption of Sensitive Information**: If the vulnerability report contains sensitive information, such as exploit code or proof-of-concept examples, please encrypt the email using our [PGP public key](link-to-pgp-key).

4. **Response Time**: We strive to acknowledge and respond to security vulnerability reports promptly. Upon receiving your report, we will assess the vulnerability and provide an estimated timeline for addressing it.

## Responsible Disclosure

We strongly encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. Please do not disclose any security-related information publicly until we have had the opportunity to address the vulnerability and provide a fix or mitigation strategy.

## Scope

This security policy applies to the ProxyScraper project hosted on GitHub. It covers all aspects related to the security of the project, including but not limited to the source code, dependencies, documentation, and project infrastructure.
